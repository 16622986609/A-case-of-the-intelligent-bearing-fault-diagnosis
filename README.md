# A-case-of-intelligent-bearing-fault-diagnosis
This is a case of bearing fault intelligent diagnosis. The program is written in MATLAB. The main techniques used are feature detection and neural network. This code comes from the undergraduate course assignment. The code has been written for 8 years. Because many students need such a simple case study, so it was sent out

2. Peak value  
3. Peak factor  
4. Kurtosis   
5. Waveform factor 
6. Margin   
7. Impulse factor
8. Mean square frequency
